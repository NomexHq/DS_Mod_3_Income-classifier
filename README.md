# DS_Mod_3_Income_classifier
Project attmepts to build an income level clasification model by applying various classification algorithms.  

## Task
Predicting income level (below or above 50K / year) based on various socio-economic attributes.  

## Data
The dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository.  
Extraction was done from the 1994 Census database.  

**Target Variable:**  
income level >50K and <=50K

**Attributes:**  
age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education-num, marital-status, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country

## Some of the data cleaning operations performed:
â‹…â‹…* useless and redundant columns removed ('fnlwgt', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'relationship')
..* transformation of categorical variables into 1 and 0
..* values that made no meaningful sense were removed
..* in order to cut down the amount of categories in variables, some of the values were removed or merged with larger categories where it was meaningful 
..* outliers were removed based on 3sd principle

## EDA insights
..* Potential issue with class inbalance

..* Gender by income distribution

..* Marital status by income distribution
